# CourseFlow Next Learning

Next.js is used for learner-facing and public pages where SEO, shareability or server rendering matters.

## Use Cases

- Public course catalog and course detail pages.
- SEO-friendly course articles/syllabi.
- Certificate verification pages.
- Authenticated learner dashboard when SSR/streaming improves perceived performance.

## Feature Layout

```text
app/                       Next.js app routes
features/
  course-catalog/          public discovery, filters, search facets
  course-detail/           syllabus, outcomes, enrollment CTA
  certificates/            public certificate verification
shared/
  api/                     BFF API client
  ui/                      reusable learner UI
```

Primary backend entrypoint: `api-gateway`.

Use `COURSEFLOW_API_URL=http://localhost:28080/api` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:28080/api` for the default local backend cluster. The learner
source already adds `/v1/...` paths.

## Keycloak Login

The learner app uses Authorization Code + PKCE against the CourseFlow Keycloak realm:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER_URI=http://localhost:18080/realms/courseflow
NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=courseflow-learner-web
```

The Keycloak access token is stored for gateway calls and refreshed through the Keycloak token
endpoint.

Training demo accounts:

| Email | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `student@courseflow.local` | `password` | `STUDENT` |
| `student2@courseflow.local` | `password` | `STUDENT` |

Run the backend training stack first, then open `http://localhost:3000/login`.
